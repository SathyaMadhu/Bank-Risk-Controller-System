**PROJECT OBJECTIVE**
   
There are two Parts in the Project Prime Part is on 
    
  **BANK RISK CONTROLLER SYSTEM**, The goal of this project is to develop a reliable predictive model that effectively identifies customers at high risk of loan default. 
This will allow the financial institution to proactively manage its credit portfolio, implement targeted strategies, and 
ultimately minimize the likelihood of loan defaults.
  
  Second Part of the Project is **"SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS"**

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**
      Python
      Data Preprocessing
      EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
      Machine Learning - Classification Model
      Visualization
      Sentimental Analysis
      Streamlit GUI

**Dashboard:** Streamlit and  Plotly

**PYTHON LIBRARIES/MODULES ENGAGED:**

    •	Import pandas as pd 
    •	Import numpy as np
    •	Import streamlit as st
    •	From streamlit_option_menu import option_menu
    •	Import plotly.express as px
    •	Import pickle
    •	From matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    •	Import seaborn as sns
    •	Import re
    •	From sklearn.preprocessing import labelencoder
    •	Import nltk
    •	From nltk.sentiment.vader import sentimentintensityanalyzer
    •	Import os
    •	From pathlib import path

**PHASES INVOLVED:**

Data Retrieval : Python scripts were employed to extract data/datasets from the CSV file

**DATA PRE-PROCESSING** : Cleaning and preparing the dataset for further Analysis
  
  •	Handling Missing Values
  •	Formatting

**DATA PROCESSING** :

  •	Categorical Data Encoding using **Label Encoder**
  •	Feature Selection : **SelectionKbest, Chi-Square and Correlation**
  •	Skewness Handling using log transformation
  •	Outlier Treatment - IQR
  •	Feature Engineering: Creating new variable to enhance the model performance
  •	Training Model
  •	Evaluating Model  

**DASHBOARD CREATION1:**

    Streamlit and Plotly libraries are used to create an interactive app and visually appealing dashboard. 
    Streamlit App helps user to assess the risk of loan default by using feeding the required data in appropriate manner
    This dashboard presents the data in efficient manner which enable users to explore the insights effectively  

**DASHBOARD CREATION2:**

    Sentimental Analysis text box to analysis the postive and negative of statements or comments given by the user

**OUTPUT INCLUDES** :

    Streamlit App to assess the risk of loan defaulter
    Visually appealing dashboard to understand the data in easy, efficient manner and along with deep insights
    Sentimental Analysis box to understand the nature/character of the statements

**CONCLUSION:**

The BANK RISK CONTROLLER SYSTEM Streamlit App helps to understand insights of various Key features of Dataset as well as helps customers to assess the risk on loan defaulters
